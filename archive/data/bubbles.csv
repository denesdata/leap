","For example, I had an entrepreneurial education class. There we were given to do a project. But the project was quite simplistic.

46,Learning,Adolescents aged 15 to 17 reported the need for ongoing and free classes for professors.,"Professors’ aggressive and authoritative attitudes and discrimination from teachers due to the grading system employed by each individual teacher, due to the fact that some teachers have preferred students and they treat other students with less attention, and due to the fact that they intend to freely express their opinions in class, and this is not appreciated/encouraged by teachers. To overcome this, participants proposed ongoing and free classes for professors focused on: child/adolescent psychology; Communication & interaction with students; Innovative/ interactive/ updated teaching methods, adapted to the needs of the students; Personal development. ","It would be interesting if there were many more activities to increase children's interest in class. It depends, each teacher can make his class more interesting if he really intends to do so, with games or activities, to make students much more active. There are different alternatives, if they really need… there are books that specialize in alternative education and if they really want, they can find them. And besides, honestly, looking at what teachers I have, and I suspect that in every school there is that type of teacher, I would send them ... I would advise them to go if there were some specialized courses for teachers. Because a lot of them are aggressive, they are bad, they are, I don't know ... insensitive. They are mean to conclude. And I don't know, it would seem to me that there should be some specialized courses for teachers, that it seems to me that not everyone has that sensitivity and that pathos of teaching, as do teachers who are really interested in the subject ...",Intergenerational conflicts,2,Qualitative research,,,,,,
