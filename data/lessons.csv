Sexual health problems were perceived as triggered by the absence of sexual education in the family environment as parents avoid speaking about sex, create an uncomfortable atmosphere around sex and approach it not from a health related perspective but from a religious one. Participants expressed that bullying is present in the family environment, through psychological pressure due to parents’ high and unrealistic expectations towards their adolescents, but also through physical violence. The family environment was also perceived as the start in building healthy patterns of eating and physical activity. In participants’ perception, the family environment is the place where adolescents should get their health-related education and health related behaviours. To improve health in youths, participants recommend that parents should 1. become educated to support their adolescents, offer them a healthy childhood, healthy advice, inform their adolescents on mental health and that mental health education should start at an early age in the family environment; 2. stop considering sex a taboo subject and should inform their offspring from an early age on sexual health related topics, to help their adolescents have healthy sexual relations, avoid unwanted pregnancies and STDs and be able to openly ask for help when needed; 3. transform home in the most secure environment to ensure optimal child development. This means not only the absence of domestic violence, but also the absence of parental pressure regarding school achievements and life achievements and the presence of parental support when the child meets bullying situations; 4. gain more appropriate info on healthy eating and should also meet child’s knowledge on healthy eating; 5. motivate their adolescents to engage in physical activity and to offer from an early age a model of being physically active. Moreover, they suggested that every parent should be trained in being a parent.  ","Parents could help a lot because they are the closest to their children and usually spend most of the time with their children….and most of the problems that youths are facing are rooted in their childhood….if parents would be educated…if all parents would be educated in order to offer their children a healthy childhood, good advices ...we could start educating parents now….before having a child everyone should go through specific classes that can help better raising the children, introducing them to the concept of mental health and of its importance….because most of the parents do not have any notion of mental health and are unaware of it.”(Adolescent girl, age group 15-17)",Adult education,5,Qualitative research,None,None,None,None,None,None

The peer group is also influential for adolescents’ eating patterns, as it is difficult to resist eating fast-food if everyone in the peer group eats unhealthy. Changes in the peer culture and in peers’ behaviours and attitudes were perceived as fundamental to youths’ wellbeing improvements.  ","“These days more and more adolescents and young people become focused on the sexual act that on developing and emotional relation and I see that there is this very strong culture that having a sex life and also having sex with many people is cool and if you don’t do it you than you are different …I feel this is wrong and I met many adolescents saying they are proud of doing it and feeling very cool because they do sex. I don’t know…I feel that actually adolescents should be taught how to protect themselves, how to take care of their body, learn about their body and understand the consequences of their behaviors and learn how to develop authentic relations with others and with the intimate partner…if we would focus on the relation and not on sex this would offer a better future for our generation. I know many people that look only the sexual pleasure but after all you can have it even with only one partner, and you can grow together with that partner and have a healthy relation.
